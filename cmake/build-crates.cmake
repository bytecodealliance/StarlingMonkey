# To avoid conflicts caused by multiple definitions of the same symbols,
# we need to build all Rust crates as part of a single staticlib.
# This is done by synthesizing a Rust crate that depends on all the others,
# and contains `pub use` statements for each of them.
#
# You might ask why we don't just do all of this in Rust itself, without CMake
# involved at all.
# A key reason is that this setup enables us to add Rust crates wherever we'd also
# be able to add C++ libraries, and have them all be built together.
# Notably, this way we can have host-API implementations that include Rust code,
# while keeping the host-API implementation fully self-contained, without changes
# outside its own folder.
